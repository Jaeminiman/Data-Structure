Herrera wins Player of the Month award for April
Ander Herrera has been voted Manchester United Player of the Month for April ahead of fellow nominees Ashley Young and Chris Smalling.
The Spaniard made four appearances, including a two-goal show in the 3-1 win over Aston Villa, to earn 63 per cent of votes cast by fans on ManUtd.com. It is the second time he has won the prize this season following his previous victory in February.
Herrera wanted to give a special thanks to supporters for voting for him, telling us: "Thank you very much to all our fans. I feel your support and I hope I can keep improving. Thank you very much!"
He has now scored seven goals in 27 appearances and is among the most popular players at United. Bryan Robson understands more than anybody why fans love an all-action midfielder and is certain Ander will be a long-term hit.
"A big part of our recent improvement is down to Herrera's form," Robbo said. "I've liked him since he arrived because he has loads of energy, closes people down and is always on the move, making space for himself. It took him a bit of time to get used to the Premier League and really pin down a place, but he's found his feet.
"He's also got the timing to get into the box and score goals - which is what he's doing at the moment - and United fans have always loved midfield players who are capable of that. I think he's going to be a really good player here for a good few years."
Look out for an exclusive interview with Herrera on ManUtd.com on Friday.
